## 🚀 Starting

Welcome to another project! This time, a professional portfolio full of visuals. Hope you like it!

## 🎬 Methods

This project uses framer-motion animation resources, built in a traditional way. As an exercise, i preferred without using styled-coponents or other css features. To get the results it was necessary to combine inline and exported framer-motion, avoiding conflicts.

## 📋 Prerequisites

* React
* Framer-Motion


## 🛠️ Built with

* Visual Studio Code

## 📌 Version

In this project I made quite long commits with didactic purposes. From version 1.0 onwards, there may be short commitments to improve the code.
