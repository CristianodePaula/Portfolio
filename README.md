# PORTFOLIO

## 🚀 Starting

Welcome to another project! This time, a professional portfolio full of visuals. Hope you like it!

## 🎬 Methods

This project uses framer-motion animation resources, built in a traditional way. As an exercise, i preferred without using styled-coponents or other css features. To get the results it was necessary to combine inline and exported framer-motion, avoiding conflicts.
